[Sqor Sports](https://sqor.com/) created an integrated program with athletes [Patrick Peterson](https://sqor.com/athlete/28396/Patrick-Peterson), [Michael Chandler](https://sqor.com/athlete/8001/Michael-Chandler) and [Sebastian Telfair](https://sqor.com/athlete/28846/Sebastian-Telfair).

  
  
Each athlete campaign leverages their fans and drives engagement on Sqor. For example, a contest was set up for Sqor Sports Fans to simply vote on Patrick's post to determine which shoe he would wear on-field. 



**The results were astounding:**

*	34.1% engagement rate, 
*	and lifelong memories to fans on Sqor Sports.
