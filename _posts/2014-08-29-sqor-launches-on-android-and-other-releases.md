#Sqor Launches Android App,Releases NFL/NCAA Football Showdowns

Sqor has much to celebrate this week: Launching their Android app, hitting 1 million pageviews year-to-date, and releasing their interactive football “Showdowns.”

####Android
Now sports fans can connect and have the ultimate insider access to their favorite athletes on the web, iOS or Android. Sqor’s release on GooglePlay™ is the next step to reach new audiences on additional devices. The Android app features editorial and social content posted in a timeline fashion by athletes and users, with notifications, comments, favorites, search capabilities, user and athlete profiles, images, video, and the ability to share via social media sites such as Facebook, and Twitter. Download the new Android app on [GooglePlay™](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sqor.droid)  or get the existing Sqor app in the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sqor/id700913088?mt=8).

"We are very excited to be launching via GooglePlay™ and bringing Sqor content to Android devices," said [Brian Wilhite](https://sqor.com/users/35304/Brian-Wilhite), CEO and Founder at Sqor.  "As one of the leading application ecosystems, we know the importance of being compatible to Android products. We highly appreciate the support that GooglePlay™ offers to app producers. We believe that Android users who are interested in sports, interactive football showdowns, athlete contests and giveaways, and real-time access to the athletes, will love what we’ve created," Wilhite said. 

Given this massive opportunity in sports, Sqor believes the biggest untapped opportunity in sports is the athlete – specifically the 99% that have powerful personal brands but no current off-the-field income. Sqor partners with over 1,500 athletes to provide fans with greater access to the players. This is especially true with the younger demographic. 


####Showdowns
To further cater to athletes and fans alike, Sqor is also rolling out "Showdowns". 
Showdowns is a feature within Sqor online (coming to mobile soon), that allows users to pick teams and predict who will win, challenge their friends, and receive virtual badges/trophies if they’re right. Showdowns are intended to encourage interaction between fans and participating athletes as they go head-to-head selecting the winning teams and top performing athletes of games throughout the season. NFL Legend and Sqor Board Member [Brett Favre](https://sqor.com/athlete/39229/Brett-Favre) is especially excited about this new feature. “It was great getting to interact with fans who were playing against me with Sqor’s Showdowns last year," Favre said. "With all the new gaming features Sqor has added, this year is going to be even better.” 

Starting in September, Sqor users who win at least 10 Showdowns will be entered to win a $500 gift card to [Fanatics](http://www.fanatics.com/). Additionally, some of Sqor’s NFL athletes, including Brett Favre, will be giving away signed memorabilia every week to Showdown users. Sqor will be adding other sports to the Showdowns such as MMA, NBA, MLB, and others in the following months.

####1M Pageviews YTD
Last but not least to celebrate: Sqor just hit 1 million YTD pageviews this past weekend. and is tracking for exponential growth for the foreseeable future. 


"Hitting this metric is a huge milestone for us at Sqor," said [Noah Gift](https://sqor.com/users/37857), CTO at Sqor."We've made it our mission to offer new features to enhance the sports experience for our users and look forward to fan enthusiasm about the elements to come, " Gift said.
