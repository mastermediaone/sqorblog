##Sqor Engineering

There are not a lot of rules here. Our culture is very simple to explain. We hire world class talent and completely trust them to do amazing work. We will use anything from functional languages to MS SQL Server. We just love building cool stuff.


##Should you work here?
**Flexibility**
While we would love for everyone to come work at our San Francisco office, we still have some remote team members. Most of us work from home at least once a week when we need to power through some code.

**Sharing and Learning**
Working with people who know things you don't is awesome. We are often learning from each other and people here enjoy sharing what they know.

**Open Source**
If we can open source something, we will. It is great for everyone and we benefit a ton from open source projects that we feel we should contribute back. Our github: @sqor.

**Creativity** 
If you like hacking on stuff on your free time, we have a lot of people like that here. We have things like Demo Mondays where the Engineering team gets to show cool stuff to the rest of the company every week.

##We Believe In:
-Continuous Deployment

-Functional Programming

-Static Analysis

-Rapid Prototyping

-Data Science and Math
