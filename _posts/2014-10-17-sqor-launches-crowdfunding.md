Sqor, Inc. (www.sqor.com), the editorial and social platform focused exclusively on sports, announces the launch of a new crowdfunding feature that allows athletes to easily raise money via the site.  Crowdfunding on Sqor may be used by athletes to finance their training and upcoming competitions, or to bring additional exposure and funds to an athlete’s philanthropic endeavors.  Whether an athlete is a young olympic hopeful or a well-known professional all-star, Crowdfunding on Sqor provides a turn-key, social tool for fundraising, that enables an athlete’s fans to play apart in the athlete’s success.  

Crowdfunding on Sqor is uniquely positioned and differentiated from other crowdfunding sites that exist because Sqor’s platform is hyper-focused on creating software tools and economic opportunities for athletes.  Crowdfunding is just one of the numerous features & economic opportunities Sqor, Inc. provides to athletes of all sports. “Our Crowdfunding product is another tool available to athletes that register with Sqor” said CEO Brian Wilhite, “our focus at Sqor, Inc. is to help the athlete in every aspect of their life that we possibly can, and we believe Crowdfunding on our platform is another step towards achieving that goal.” 

TeamSqor athletes that have begun campaigns for various charities and causes they feel strongly about include: [Brett Favre](https://sqor.com/athlete/39229/Brett-Favre) through his foundation, Favre4Hope, [Calais Cambell](https://sqor.com/athlete/4314/Calais-Campbell) through his CRC Foundation, and Darrin Walls for the Bright Pink Foundation to support Breast Cancer Awareness month.

Retired NFL legend Brett Favre vocalized his support of Crowdfunding on Sqor by announcing that he will be raising funds for his foundation Favre4Hope which helps breast cancer survivors and children with disabilities. “This is a great opportunity for athletes to take their passion projects to the next level and raise money for good causes. The team at Sqor, Inc. got me set up quickly and easily, and I’m looking forward to a successful campaign raising money for the Favre4Hope foundation.”  Athletes that are interested in taking advantage of CrowdFunding on Sqor should contact the company’s Athlete team <athletes@sqor.com> to get their campaign set up.
