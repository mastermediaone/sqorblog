We are very excited to announce a partnership with [TOK.tv](http://www.tok.tv/), a leader in voice-enabled Social TV. 

Tok.tv released the "Tok Social Button" this week. This SDK enables all sport apps social, while monetizing through TV-synced advertising. It works as a Social TV layer for all sport apps, enabling any developer to easily integrate the TOK.tv core features in its app.

“The TOK Social Button has a key function: transform any sport app into a Social hub, bringing the emotion of watching sport together to fans of every sport”, said TOK.tv Chief Executive Officer, Fabrizio Capobianco in a press release

Users click on on the TOK Social Button inside an app to talk to a friend, chat, make fun sounds and take a “social selfie” while watching a game. The SDK comes with ACR technology which recognizes advertising on TV and delivers synced ads on mobile devices. This technology creates new and significant revenue opportunities for marketers. 

“Sqor, Inc is excited to be one of the select TOK.tv SDK partners," said Brian Wilhite, Founder and CEO of Sqor, Inc. "As innovators in sports technology we are looking forward to integrating TOK.tv SDK across our editorial and social content platform that is focused exclusive on sports.  Our sports specific social platform delivers thousands of engagements between professional athletes and fans daily, and the TOK Social Button will add fuel to our engagement fire. This integration will include our web, and mobile assets.”

Starting today, the TOK Social Button will be available to a group of selected partners.
